# simpleReactTodoList

A simple Todo List application built using react.js. This project was build for general learning and practice purposes. It was also build because I did not want to pay to download such a simple todolist application with fluff-features from the app store.

The application is simple. Simply type out a task and hit submit, the task then gets saved to your list. You can select the bubble to the left of the item to mark it as completed, without deleting it from the list. You can also click the red "x" to the right of the task item to remove it from the list entirely.
